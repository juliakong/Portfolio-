    <div class="col-sm-9 col-md-8">
    <div id = "hatg-container-left">

    <p>Currently, a majority of women under the age 40 do not regularly perform proper breast self-examinations (BSE). This prevents young women from detecting breast cancer at the earliest stages, when breast cancer is most effectively and least invasively treated. Our challenge is to empower women under the age of 40 to proactively and properly perform breast self-examinations.  </p>

      <h5> WHAT'S THE INSIGHT? </h5>
    </div>
  </div>
    <div class="col-sm-9 col-md-8">
    <div id = "hatg-container-left">

    <p>The current lack of educated proactivity can be attributed to a variety of reasons that include: fear (of discovering one indeed has breast cancer), naivete (the misconception that young women do not develop breast cancer), and misinformation (BSEs performed irregularly and/or improperly). As a result, there is a common “invincible youth” mentality that belittles the reality of breast cancer and holds young women back from at least performing BSEs (as women are generally suggested to get regular clinical screenings once at the age of 40). Our solution must address young women’s perceptions of breast cancer and BSEs in order to break down this mental barrier. It should not only promote performing BSEs as normal, encouraged, and routine, but also allow for more commonplace opportunities to perform them. </p>

    <div class="col-sm-9 col-md-8">
    <div id = "hatg-container-left">

    <p>Our solution is a fitting room sticker-diagram installation that takes advantage of the privacy and convenience of clothing store fitting rooms. The fundamental component of this installation is a discreet yet eye-catching sticker placed on the edge of the fitting room mirror. This sticker, with a modern design culturally targeted towards young women, would state “How Are The Girls?” and direct the viewer upwards to pull down a discreet window shade-style diagram installed above the mirror to “find out”.*  Pulled down, this shade would have a detailed infographic on how to properly perform a BSE on the spot in front of the mirror.  </p>
